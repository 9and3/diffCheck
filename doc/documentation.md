# Documentation

In DF we use `Sphinx` to generate the documentation. The documentation is written in `reStructuredText` and `Markdown` and the source files are located in the `doc` folder. The documentation is hosted on `ReadTheDocs` and is automatically updated when a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.

Documentation is autogenerated for:

- [GHComponents](gh_components.rst) for the  DF Grasshopper plug-in
- [Python API](diffCheck_PythonAPI) for the DF Python API


```{note}
If you need to add a new page to the documentation (e.g. a [new tutorial](tutorials.rst)), you can do so by adding a new `.rst` file in the `doc` folder and linking it in the `index.rst` file.
