Assembly Evaluation
===================


The following tutorial will guide you through the evaluation of assemblies in timber construction with DF. We tested three assembly study cases:

1. Roof structure segment crafted by augmented workers and assembled manually.
2. Frame structure with four wood logs connected by CNC-fabricated half-lap cross joints.
3. Spatial structure assembled by two robots and a human.
