DiffCheck: CAD-Point cloud comparison
=====================================

JAX is a Python library for accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation,
designed for high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning.

If you're looking to train neural networks, use Flax_ and start with its documentation.
Some associated tools are Optax_ and Orbax_.
For an end-to-end transformer library built on JAX, see MaxText_.
