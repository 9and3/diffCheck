# Dev log for DiffCheck
The log is used to keep track of the changes made to the project and to provide a history of the project's development.

## 2024-03-15 kick off meeting (@Eleni, @Andrea, @Damien)

Goal backend: develop local and global registrations and segmentation of the joints based on the 3D model and the index of faces that are part of a joint + test suite with different quality of point clouds, and evaluate quality of different registration techniques

### Roadmap

1) DATA (1-2 Weeks)

    Ground Truth (populated 3D model) 5 steps from simple to complex based on: (for pieces and joints)
   	 How big,
   	 density (how similar the elements are),
   	 number,
   	 geometric distinctiveness
    Test scan (synthetic PC)

2) Registration (2 Weeks)
    Find a good registration for full model registration and test it on data

3) Semantic seg. from 3D model (1 Week)
    
4) Local registration (2 Weeks)

5) Error computation (1 Week)

6) Present results (1 Week)

NEXT TIME:

    --> @Eleni: Have the 3D models + joints (some preliminary in 1 weekâ€™s time)
    --> @Damien Make SOTA, main registration methods (finished by next week)
    --> @Andrea Setup GitHub (finished by next week)

NB: Robotic fabrication: Position of fabricated object already known and position of scanner already known so no big global registration to perform.
